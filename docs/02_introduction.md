`wf-tb-amr` is a workflow for determining the antibiotic resistance of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis targeted sequencing samples. The workflow handles
multiplexed sequencing runs and provides clear and simple reports summarising
the predicted resistance profile of each sample according to genetic variants
discovered.
